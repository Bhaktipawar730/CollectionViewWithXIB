# CollectionViewWithXIB

**CollectionViewWithXIB** is a Swift project demonstrating how to implement a collection view with custom cells created using a XIB file. The project showcases a grid of fruits, displaying their images and names in a visually appealing layout.

## Features
- Displays a collection view with a grid layout.
- Uses a custom `UICollectionViewCell` designed in a XIB file.
- Dynamically resizes cells for a two-column grid with spacing.
- Supports a list of fruits with corresponding images and names.

## Files
1. **ViewController.swift**  
   Handles the collection view setup, data source, and delegate methods.
   
2. **CollectionViewCell.swift**  
   Defines the custom `UICollectionViewCell` with an image and label.

## How It Works
- The collection view is registered with the custom cell created in the XIB file.
- Fruit data (images and names) is displayed in each cell.
